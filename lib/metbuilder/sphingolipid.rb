		#The sphingolipid abbreviation format includes the specifications of a long 
		#chain base and an N-acyl chain on the ceramide backbone along with the specification 
		#of a head group: Headgroup(LongChainBase/NAcylChain). One of the three letters
		#- d, t, or m - must precede the chain length specifier of the long chain base; the
		#format of rest of the long chain base and N-acyl chain abbreviation is similar to the
		#format of chain abbreviation for other lipid categories. The letters t and m are used
		#to represent 4R-hydroxy and 3-keto groups at positions 4 and 3 respectively in the 
		#long chain base. Representative examples of the lipid abbreviations format for SP 
		#are: Cer(d18:1(4E)/14:0), Cer(t18:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)) and Cer(m14:0/16:1(9Z)). These abbreviations
		#correspond to N-(tetradecanoyl)-sphing-4-enine, N-(9Z,12Z-octadecadienoyl)-4R-hydroxy-sphinganine
		#and N-(9Z-hexadecenoyl)-3-keto-tetradecasphinganine.

			@definition = "#{abbrev}, also known as sphinganine or safingol, is a dihydrosphingosine (DHS). #{general_1}. In humans, #{@classe} is produced by the reduction of 3-dehydrosphinganine by the enzyme 3-dehydrosphinganine reductase, which is then followed by an acylation reaction through the enzyme ceramide synthase to produce dihydroceramide. This compound can be later desaturated to form ceramide. DHS is a biosynthetic precursor of sphingosine biosynthesis. DHS is also an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) and blocks phospholipases A2 (PLA2) and the D-sphingosine precursor. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) and sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) are two kinases which convert DHS to dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (DHS1P) in mammalian cells. While SK1 efficiently converts DHS to its phosphorylated derivatives, SK2 is less efficient at phosphorylating DHS (PMID: 16529909). DHS is a blocker post lysosomal cholesterol transport by inhibition of low-density lipoprotein-induced esterification of cholesterol. This causes unesterified cholesterol to accumulate in perinuclear vesicles. It has been suggested that endogenous sphinganine may inhibit cholesterol transport in Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease (PMID: 1817037). #{general_2} is a colorless solid which consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

In humans, #{@classe} is produced by the desaturation of dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine) by the enzyme sphingolipid 4-desaturase, or by the hydrolysis of phytoceramide. PHS is one of the most widely distributed natural SPs, which is abundant in fungi and plants, and also found in animals including humans. While the synthesis of sphinganine in plants has been investigated, the metabolic origin of PHS is not known, although, recent experiments showed that PHS is involved in the heat stress response of the yeast. PHS is structurally similar to sphingosine, PHS possesses a hydroxyl group at C-4 of the sphingoid long-chain base. The physiological roles of PHS are largely unknown. PHS induces apoptosis in human T-cell lymphoma and non-small cell lung cancer cells, and induces caspase-independent cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In the presence of caspase inhibitors, phytosphingosine-induced apoptosis is almost completely suppressed, suggesting that phytosphingosine-induced apoptosis is largely dependent on caspase activities.

In humans, #{@classe} is produced by the hydrolysis of ceramide (N-Acylsphingosine) by the enzyme alkaline ceramidase (since a ceramide is composed of sphingosine and a fatty acid) which could later be phosphorylated to sphingosine-1P (sphingosine-1-phosphate/S1P) by the enzyme sphingosine kinase which in turn could be dephosphorylated back to sphingosine by the enzyme S1P phosphatase 2. SPN could also go through reacylation to from ceramide by the enzyme ceramide synthase. #{general_2} consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

CBs consist of a ceramide with a single sugar residue which could be either glucose or galactose; the two major types are therefore called glucocerebrosides (glucosylceramides) and galactocerebrosides (galactosylceramides). Galactocerebrosides are typically found in neural tissue, while glucocerebrosides are found in other tissues such as the spleen and erythrocytes. In humans, glucosylceramide is produced by the enzyme ceramide glucosyltransferase from a ceramide or by the enzyme beta-galactosidase from a lactosylceramides (LacCer). The latter could also be produced from glucosylceramides by the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6. Glucosylceramide could be hydrolyzed by the enzyme glucosylceramidase to produce a ceramide. Galactosylceramide on the other hand could undergo sulfoglycolipid biosynthesis to produce a sulfatide which in turn can be catalyzed by the enzyme arylsulfatase A to generate a galactosylceramide. Galactosylceramide could also be hydrolyzed to produce a ceramide by the enzyme galactosylceramidase. Other sources for galactosylceramide are ganglioside and digalactosylceramide, which are catalyzed by the enzymes sialidase-2/3/4 and alpha-galactosidase respectively. #{general_2} consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

By contrast with animals, sphingomyelin, globosides, sulfatides or gangliosides are absent in plants, but GIPCs, glycosylceramide and ceramide account for ca. 64%, 34% and 2%, respectively, of total sphingolipids in Arabidopsis. #{general_2} consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

It is also referred to as a bioactive lipid mediator. DHS1P can be dephosphorylated by the enzyme phosphatidate phosphatase to produce dihydrosphingosine which in turn can undergo phosphorylation by the enzyme sphingosine kinase. DHS1P can also be catabolized by the enzyme sphinganine-1-phosphate aldolase to produce phosphoethanolamine. DHS1P is a substrate for sphingosine kinase 1, lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase 2, sphingosine kinase 2, sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1, lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase 1 and lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase 3.

Fast-migrating cerebrosides have been identified in rat, bovine and human brain tissue, and determined to vary by species from 15 to 35% of tissue GalCer content. FMC-5 is one of the most complex glycosphingolipid and has been characterized as more complex penta-acetyl derivative, containing 3-O-acetyl-sphingosine-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-GalCer. #{general_2} consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

In humans, #{@classe} are formed from ceramides by the action of a specific ceramide kinase (CerK) and can be dephosphorylated by phosphatidate phosphatase back to the ceramide. CerPs are an important metabolite of ceramide as it acts as a mediator of the inflammatory response. CerPs are also known to have a dual regulatory capacity acting as intracellular second messengers to regulate cell survival, or as extracellular receptor ligands to stimulate chemotaxis. Moreover, CerPs have been shown to be specific and potent inducers of arachidonic acid and prostanoid synthesis in cells through the translocation and activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2. #{general_2} is a colorless solid that consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

Ceramides are also one of the hydrolysis byproducts of sphingomyelins (SMs) through the action of the enzyme sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, which has been identified in the subcellular fractions of human epidermis (PMID: 25935) and many other tissues. Ceramides can also be synthesized from serine and palmitate in a de novo pathway and are regarded as important cellular signals for inducing apoptosis (PMID: 14998372).

DHCers are produced in the third to last step in the synthesis of beta-D-Galactosyl-1,4-beta-D glucosylceramide and then converted from sphinganine via the enzyme acyl-CoA-dependent ceramide synthase (EC 2.3.1.24). DHCers are then converted into N-acylsphingosine via the enzyme fatty acid desaturase (EC 1.14.-.-). Dihydrosphingosines (DHSs) are acylated by the enzyme ceramide synthase to produce DHCer which is later desaturated by the enzyme sphingolipid 4-desaturase to form ceramide (Cer) or phytoceramide (PHC). DHCers have unique biological functions that are being uncovered in autophagy, hypoxia, and cellular proliferation. #{general_2} is a colorless solid that consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

DHSM lacks the trans double bond at position 4 (C4) in the long-chain base making it practically insoluble (in water). #{general_2} consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."
		elsif @classe == "glucosylceramide"
			@definition = "#{abbrev}, also known as cerebroside (CB), glycosphingolipid or glycoceramide, is a glucosylceramide (GlcCer). #{general_1}. Cerebroside is the common name for monoglycosylceramides which are important components in animal muscle and nerve cell membranes. In terms of their chemical structure, GlcCers can either be glycosphingolipids (ceramide and oligosaccharide) or oligoglycosylceramides with one or more sialic acids (i.e. n-acetylneuraminic acid) linked on the sugar chain. GlcCers are important components of the cell plasma membrane, which modulates cell signal transduction events. Gangliosides have been found to be very important in immunology. Gangliosides can amount to 6% of the weight of lipids from brain, but they are found at lower levels in other animal tissues. There are four types of glycosphingolipids, the cerebrosides, sulfatides, globosides and gangliosides. CBs consist of a ceramide with a single sugar residue which could be either glucose or galactose; the two major types are therefore called glucocerebrosides (glucosylceramides; containing glucose) and galactocerebrosides (galactosylceramides; containing galactose). Galactocerebrosides are the most common and are typically found in neuronal cell membrane, while glucocerebrosides are the least common and are found in other tissues such as the spleen and erythrocytes. Glucocerebrosides are not normally found in cell membranes. Instead, they are typically intermediates in the synthesis or degradation of more complex glycosphingolipids. In humans, glucosylceramide is produced by the enzyme ceramide glucosyltransferase from a ceramide or by the enzyme beta-galactosidase from a lactosylceramides (LacCer). The latter could also be produced from glucosylceramides by the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6. Glucosylceramide could be hydrolyzed by the enzyme glucosylceramidase to produce a ceramide. Galactosylceramide on the other hand could undergo sulfoglycolipid biosynthesis to produce a sulfatide which in turn can be catalyzed by the enzyme arylsulfatase A to generate a galactosylceramide. Galactosylceramide could also be hydrolyzed to produce a ceramide by the enzyme galactosylceramidase. Other sources for galactosylceramide are ganglioside and digalactosylceramide, which are processed by the enzymes sialidase-2/3/4 and alpha-galactosidase respectively. Excess lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebrosides is found in Gaucher disease, which is an inborn error of metabolism. #{general_2} is a colorless solid that consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

It is the product of the reaction of serine palmitoyl-CoA by serine palmitoyltransferase, which is then followed by a reduction reaction by the enzyme 3-dehydrosphinganine reductase (that in humans is encoded by the KDSR gene) to form dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine). #{general_2} is a colorless solid that consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."
		elsif @classe == "lactosylceramide"
			@definition = "#{abbrev}, also known as beta-D-Galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosylceramide, is a lactosylceramide (LacCer). #{general_1}. LacCers are the most important and abundant of the diosylceramides. LacCers were originally called 'cytolipin H'. They are found in small amounts only in animal tissues, but LacCers have a number of significant biological functions and they are of great importance as biosynthetic precursors to most of the neutral oligoglycosylceramides, sulfatides and gangliosides. In animal tissues, biosynthesis of LacCers involves the addition of a second monosaccharides unit (galactose) as a nucleotide derivative to monoglucosylceramide. This is catalysed by a specific beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase on the lumenal side of the Golgi apparatus. The glucosylceramide precursor must first cross from the cytosolic side of the membrane, possibly via the action of a flippase. The LacCer produced can be further glycosylated or transferred to the plasma membrane. LacCers may assist in stabilizing the plasma membrane and activating receptor molecules in special lipid micro-domains or lipid rafts, as with the cerebrosides. LacCers may also have their own specialized function in the immune system in that LacCers are known to bind to specific bacteria. In addition, it is believed that a number of pro-inflammatory factors activate LacCer synthase to generate LacCer, which in turn activates 'oxygen-sensitive' signalling pathways that affect such cellular processes as proliferation, adhesion, migration and angiogenesis. Dysfunctions in these pathways can lead to several diseases of the cardiovascular system, cancer and other inflammatory conditions, so LacCer metabolism is a potential target for new therapeutic treatments. Beta-D-Galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosylceramide is the second to last step in the synthesis of N-acylsphingosines and is converted. from glucosylceramide via the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6 (EC:2.4.1.-). It can be converted into glucosylceramide via the enzyme beta-galactosidase (EC:3.2.1.23). #{general_2} is a colorless solid that consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

Thus, ethanolaminephosphotransferase is a class of enzymes that uses ceramide and a donor molecule for phosphoethanolamine as substrates to produce CPE and a side product. While sphingomyelin (SM) is the major sphingolipid in mammals, previous studies indicate that mammalian cells also produce the SM analog, CPE. Little is known about the biological role of CPE or the enzyme(s) responsible for CPE biosynthesis. #{general_2} consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

Generally, Ceramide is a precursor for complex sphingolipids in vertebrates, while plants contain PHC. PHCs are a family of waxy plant-based lipid molecules. Previously, only trace amounts of phytoceramide were reported in vertebrate intestine, kidney, and skin. While its function is still ambiguous. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated phytoceramide characterization in glial cells and vertebrate brain, heart, and liver. PHC could be produced by the desaturation of dihydroceramide by the enzyme sphingolipid 4-desaturase. #{general_2} consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

			@definition = "#{abbrev}, also known as sulfatide, 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide, SM4, or sulfated galactocerebroside, is a galactosylceramide-sulfate (SGalCer). #{general_1}. SGalCer is a galactosylceramide substituted at O3 of galactose by a sulfo group. Sulfatides are a class of sulfolipids, specifically a class of sulfoglycolipids, which are glycolipids that contain a sulfate group. In humans, This lipid occurs in membranes of various cell types, but is found in particularly high concentrations in myelin where it constitutes 3-4% of total membrane lipids. This lipid is synthesized primarily in the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Accumulation of this lipid in the lysosomes is a characteristic of metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase A. Alterations in sulfatide metabolism, trafficking, and homeostasis are present in the earliest clinically recognizable stages of Alzheimer's disease. SGalCer is generated from galactosylceramide by the enzyme galactosylceramide sulfotransferase. #{general_2} consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."
		elsif @classe == "sphingomyelin"
			@definition = "#{abbrev} is a sphingomyelin (SM). #{general_1}. SM is the major sphingolipid in mammals it is found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of phosphocholine and ceramide, or a phosphoethanolamine head group. In humans, #{@classe} is the only membrane phospholipid not derived from glycerol. SM contains one polar head group, which is either phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine. The plasma membrane of cells is highly enriched in sphingomyelin and is considered largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 - an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there. Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann-Pick Disease, types A and B. Niemann-Pick disease is a genetically-inherited disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sphingomyelinase, which causes the accumulation of sphingomyelin in spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage. SMs play a role in signal transduction. Sphingomyelins are synthesized by the transfer of phosphorylcholine from phosphatidylcholine to a ceramide in a reaction catalyzed by sphingomyelin synthase. #{general_2} consists of #{baseChain_} #{@schain1.split(':')[0][1..-1]}-carbon sphingoid base with #{sideChain_}#{st[0]} fatty acid side chain. #{general_3}."

			@definition = "#{abbrev} belongs to the family of #{classe}s. #{$lipid_class_definitions[classe+"s"][0]} Sphingolipids are found in cell membranes, particularly nerve cells and brain tissue. Sphingolipids are extremely versatile molecules that have functions controlling fundamental cellular processes such as cell division, differentiation, and cell death. A well-balanced SP metabolism is important for health. Moreover, an impaired SP metabolism are involved in many common human diseases such as diabetes, various cancers, microbial infections, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, diseases of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and other neurological syndromes. The biosynthesis and catabolism of sphingolipids involves a large number of intermediate metabolites where many different enzymes are involved. Sphingolipids can be distinguished in neutral and negatively charged classes. Their biosynthesis starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the formation of ceramide.
